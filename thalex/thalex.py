        removed. If a double-sided quote for an instrument that was specified in an earlier call is omitted from the next

        Sending a quote with the exact same price and amount as in the previous call *will* replace the quote, which
        will result in the quote losing priority. It is thus advised to avoid sending duplicate quotes.

        Note that mass quoting only allows for a one level quote on each side on the instrument. I.e. if you specify
        two or more double sided quotes on the same instrument then the quotes occurring earlier in the list will be
        replaced by the quotes occurring later in the list, as if all the double sided quotes for the same instrument
        were sent in separate API calls.
